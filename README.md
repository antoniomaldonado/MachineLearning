# Machine Learning

Different types of machine learning problems (Regression, Classification and Clustering) and the method to solve them.

## Supervised Learning
### REGRESSION
#### Linear
Prediction Model for palladium prices displayed in a graph.
* Machine learning classifier used: sklearn.LinearRegression
#### Linear wit ANN
Prediction model basedn on some historic data of miles per gallon prices.
* Machine learning classifier used: keras.Sequential
### CLASSIFICATION
#### Nearest Neighbor
Prediction model based on some tumor data input.
* Machine learning classifier used: sklearn.KNeighborsClassifier
#### Artificial Neural Network
Prediction model based on some historic data about lung and breast cancer.
* Machine learning classifier used: keras.Sequential
#### Recurrent Neural Network
Prediction model for Bitcoin price.
* Machine learning classifier used: keras.Sequential

## Unsupervised Learning
#### FLAT CLUSTERING: KMeans
Given the tumor data set from a study cluster the data in survived or didn't survived groups.
#### HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING: KMeans
Given the tumor data set from a study the survival in groups.
