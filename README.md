# Machine Learning

Different types of machine learning problems (Regression, Classification and Clustering) and the method to solve them.

## Supervised Learning
#### REGRESSION: Linear
Given the palladium prices create a price prediction and display the price in a graph.
#### CLASSIFICATION: Nearest Neighbor
Given some tumor data, predict the tumor type of a new data input.
#### CLASSIFICATION: Support Vector Machine

## Unsupervised Learning
#### FLAT CLUSTERING: KMeans
Given the tumor data set from a study cluster the data in survived or didn't survived groups.
#### HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING: KMeans
Given the tumor data set from a study the survival in groups.
